# CS228_DeepLearningProject
The proposed project is a Solar Power Prediction Model employing the following regression methods : Gaussian Process Regression, Support Vector Regression and Deep Neural Network. The dataset being used is a combination of two data sources containing sensor and power generation plant data by performing an inner join operation. The primary key used for the inner join is performed is the "DATE_TIME" attribute. The "AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE", "MODULE_TEMPERATURE" & "IRRADIATION" is obtained from the sensor dataset which contains these parameters recorded at 15 minute intervals throughout the day. Similarly, the power generation plant dataset contains the power generated across all inverters in the plant at 15 minute intervals throughout the day. The values of features ambient temperature, module temperature and irradiation are replicated as the plant has only one sensor for all inverters.The proposed methods focus only on predicting the DC_POWER because it is the direct output of the solar panel. In addition to this, the other parameters such as AC_POWER and the aggregation labels of DAILY_YIELD and TOTAL_YIELD can be derived from the predicted values of DC_POWER. To calculate the DC_POWER, a logarithmic scale is used primarily because it reduces the number of negative values returned by the neural network while making predictions.
